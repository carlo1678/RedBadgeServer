# RedBadgeServer

This is the server side of things for my Red Badge Project! The goal for this project was to be able to create a Music Application where people could
find songs, add them to their favorites list, and the comment on individual songs of their liking! 

# Technologies
I utilized Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL! Each individual model has routes that equal out to full CRUD!

# Timeframe
I had about three weeks to complete this project!

# Lessons Learned
I learned a lot about the connection between the front-end and the back-end for this project. Working with React, and utilzing the back-end has been a tough
challenge, but it's only going to make me a better developer in the longrun!
